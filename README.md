# DS-Practice (Java)

This repository contains my **Java practice programs** for understanding core programming concepts and fundamental **Data Structures** like Stack and Queue.

## 🧠 Topics Practiced So Far

- Control Flow (if-else, loops)
- Operators
- Stack implementation in Java
- Queue and Circular Queue implementations

## 📁 Files Overview

- `control_flow.java` – Basic control flow examples
- `operators.java` – Java operators practice
- `stack2.java` – Stack implementation
- `queue3.java`, `c_queue4.java` – Queue and Circular Queue programs

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Language: Java
- IDE:VS Code

## 💡 Purpose

- Strengthen my DSA basics with Java
- Build a habit of problem-solving through code
- Prepare for future DSA topics (Trees, Graphs, Recursion, etc.)

> This repo will grow as I practice more topics like Linked Lists, Trees, Recursion, Sorting, and more in Java.
